## About the app

- Price Assist helps the users to get the best price for their used old cars in a matter of minutes.
- Our app makes use of the various specifications of your car like mileage, brand, kilometers driven, etc. to predict its most optimal selling price.
- If someone is interested to buy a second-hand vehicle, they will know whether the price offered by the seller is overpriced or not.
